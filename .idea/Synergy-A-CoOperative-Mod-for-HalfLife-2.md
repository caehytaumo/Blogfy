It was released in 2007 and has evolved from multiple mods (DC Co-op 2, Dev Co-op and Tim-Coop)[^5^]. The mod features its own levels and the ability to play the Half-Life 2, Episode One and Episode Two campaigns cooperatively. In addition, you can add more content by installing third-party mods, such as ROCK 24 and MINERVA: Metastasis, then playing them in Synergy[^4^].
